# Disc Golf putting_app

A mobile application for tracking and viewing my disc golf putting progress.

### Basics

The app has two main screens:
1. The setup screen
2. The putting screen

On the setup screen, the user can select the exact variation of putting that he is practicing as well as leave notes.

On the putting screen, there is a counter that will increment when the user presses the right side of the screen and decrement when the left is pressed. The intent is that user throws as many putters as they have, and then press the right side of the screen. The app will then ask how many discs made it into the basket which the user can select from the large buttons. The total count of throws will be saved along with the amount of makes.

Once finished practicing that particular setup of throwing, the user can log the session by pressing the submit button. This will take all the information about the session and save it to a local database which can then be exported for reference.

### The future

In the future, I think this will be more than a putting app. I would like to include all of my practice routines here. See the project view for a peek inside what I'm currently working on.

### Use the app

Clone the master branch and build on your own device. You'll need to have flutter and all the accociated programs installed. I'm hoping to make installation a lot easier soon, and eventually have the app in the Play and App stores.
